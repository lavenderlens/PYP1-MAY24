'''
functions, as in any otehr language, wrap one or more LOC in a function name
to be called zero, one, or many times at some time in the future
how short can a function be?
1 LOC
why? to make code more declarative
the function name may be more descriptive than its workings
how long can afunction be?
Not too long.
As a rule of thumb I would be wary of functions over 50-100 LOC
It is very likely they will have dependencies on other code.
If that other code were to break, so would your function.
You may never know this while unit testing

# as it stands, the function breaks principle of idempotence
# or, out another way, function is IMPURE
# all functions should be idempotent and pure
# the result should not change for the given input, including nothing
# the way to solve this is actually very simple
# if we provide a parameter to the function
# the function passes in a COPY of the data at runtime
# definition time: parameters
# runtime: arguments
