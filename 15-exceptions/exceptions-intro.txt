Exception Handling
------------------
Exception: an error; some exceptional situation; something that causes the interpreter to crash
Compilation error: a syntax error in the code
Logic error: syntactically correct code that doesn't work as expected
Exception handling deals with errors that are not of the devs making but are nonetheless anticipatable
Exception handling is NOT for compilation or logic errors
We may choose to create our own custom exceptions and raise them at strategic points in our code
This is not as strange as it may sound: better that an object, say, with null/None fields is NOT created
