Objects
In this exercise you will create a class to model a Training Course object. The class will
contain both data and method attributes. The data attributes will consist of a course title,
a duration ( in days ), a course price and a list of delegate names. The Training Course
object will also require methods: a method to add a name to the delegate list and a
method to display the total revenue generated for the Training Course object.
1. Create a script called ch7_training_course.py.
2. Create a class called TrainingCourse
3. Add a dunder __init__ method to ensure that a TrainingCourse object is created
with the following data attributes: title, duration, pricePerPerson and an empty list
called delegates.
4. Add a method called addDelegates that will accept a delegate name as a parameter
and then append it to the delegates list i.e. delegates.append(name).
5. Add method called getTotalRevenue which will return the total revenue generated for
the Training Course object i.e. number of delegates * pricePerPerson.
6. Create a TrainingCourse object with the data attributes set to the following values:
title: Python Programming 1
duration: 4
price per person: 1600
delegates: [ ]
7. Use the addDelegate method to assign some names to the Training Course
objectâ€™s delegates list.
8. Display to the console the total revenue generated for the TrainingCourse object.
