'''
Loops come in two sorts: the while loop and the for loop
# while loops are commonly used for console IO
# there may be no obvious end to the process
# for loops are commonly used to iterate over containers
# the length of the container is known in advance
The for loop in Python is syntactic sugar for a while loop, 
usually when the number of iterations is known in advance.
There are no for loops at runtime, only while loops that the code is compiled into.
While loops in source code are useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

In Python, an optional else clause may be added to the end of both types of loop, for and while.
It is executed if the loop completes and doesn't hit a break statement.
In other words, if the loop completes normally.
To make this clearly readable, add a comment "# no break" next to the else clause.

# for is used for iterating through an ireable object, typically a container
# remember, lists, sets, and tuples have a len() length prop

# we could certainly using list comprehensions
# we may also apply a slice to the list variable name
