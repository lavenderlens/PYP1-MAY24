Part 1 Conditions
In this exercise you will create a script that prompts the user to input his/her birth year,
and then prints to the console the generation of which he/she is a member, e.g. Baby
Boomer, Generation X, etc.
1. Create a script named ch5_conditions.py.
2. Prompt the user to input his/her birth year and capture it in a variable named
birth_year.
3. Convert birth_year to an int.
4. If the user was born between 1946 and 1965, print Baby Boomer to the console.
5. If the user was born between 1966 and 1976, print Generation X to the console.
6. If the user was born between 1977 and 1994, print Millennial to the console.
7. If the user was born in 1995 or beyond, print Generation Z to the console.

Part 2 Loops
In this exercise you will create a number guess game. It will prompt the user to guess the
magic number between 1 and 10. If the user guesses correctly, it will print a winner
message and exit. If the user guesses incorrectly, he/she will be prompted again. The user
will be given three go's after which, if he/she has not guessed correctly the script will
print a loser message.
1. Create a script named ch5_loops.py.
2. Import the random module as follows:
import random
3. Declare and assign a variable as follows:
magic_number = random.randint(1, 10)
4. Code a loop that iterates three times.
5. Inside the loopâ€¦
a. Prompt the user to input a guess and capture it in a variable named
user_guess.
b. If the user's guess equals the magic number, print a winner message to the
console and break out of the loop.
c. If the user's guess does not equal the magic number, print an appropriate
message, e.g. too low or too high.
6. If the loop exits normally, the user has not guessed correctly so print a suitable
consolation message to the console.
