Lists
In this exercise you will create a script that emulates a sporting league table. Teams will
move up and down the table, some will be relegated and some will be promoted. The
team at index 0 (zero) is to be considered on top of the table.
1. Create a script named ch8_lists.py.
2. Declare a variable named table and assign it a list of teams (strings) as follows:
Bath, Derby, Gloucester, Lancaster, Newcastle, Plymouth, Salford, and Wakefield.
3. Move Newcastle into 3rd position (remove and then insert).
4. Move Derby into 4th position.
5. Relegate (remove) Salford.
6. Promote (append) Canterbury at the bottom of the table.
7. In one statement, relegate Plymouth and promote York (update).
8. Extract the top two teams into a new list named to_play_in_europe.
9. If Newcastle is to play in Europe, print Newcastle to play in Europe to the
console.
10. Code a loop that iterates over the table.
11. Inside the loop print each team to the console. The output should be as follows:
Bath
Newcastle
Gloucester
Derby
Lancaster
York
Wakefield
Canterbury
