Modules and packages
____________________

modules are scripts imported for use in other scriptsin this way, core struxtures like functions and classes
need not be tightly coupled to the code that calls them
and may also be re-used by other caller code

packages are collections of modules (OR sub-packages)
a package folder has a file in named __init__.py 
this initially confusing naming enables code to be run from the file whenever the package is imported
need not have anything in the __init__ file but should be there

there is a variant without the __init__ file
this is called a namespace package

there are 4 broad categories of modules

1. modules ("batteries included") - work "straight out the box"
already included in the standard Python install, eg str, 
imported by default

2. modules already included in a standard Python install
but you must import them, eg. math

for further example you didn't need to import builtins for len(), min(), max() etc
but math, random, sqlite3, need explicit imports

3. modules you install typically from PYPI public repo using PYPI
https://pypi.org 
for data science, the anaconda distribution is standard/very popular
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest

4. modules YOU create, and, optionally, open source
